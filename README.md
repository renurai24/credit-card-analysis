Project Title: Executive Dashboard for Credit Card Transaction Analysis
This project involves the creation of an executive dashboard tailored for analyzing credit card transaction data. 
This dashboard aims to provide executives with actionable insights into key metrics 
such as revenue, transaction volume, spending trends, and customer behavior. 
By visualizing data through charts, graphs, and interactive elements, executives can quickly identify trends,
make informed decisions, and drive strategic initiatives.

The dashboard will include features such as:
Total revenue and transaction volume metrics displayed over time.
Breakdown of transactions by card type, expenditure type, and gender.
Top cities by transaction volume and monthly spending trends.
Dynamic and interactive elements for deeper exploration of data.
Customizable themes to suit different preferences and corporate aesthetics.
Utilizing DAX functions and appropriate visualizations, we will ensure that the dashboard offers comprehensive insights while maintaining simplicity and usability. Regular feedback and iteration will be incorporated to enhance the dashboard's effectiveness and relevance over time.

Overall, our goal is to empower executives with a powerful tool that facilitates data-driven decision-making, drives business growth, and enhances overall organizational performance.
